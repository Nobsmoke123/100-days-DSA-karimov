# Tree

A tree is a non-linear data-structure. It is a type of heirarchical data structure that simulates a tree-like model.

Root = The top node without a parent
Edge = A link between parent and child
Leaf = A node which does not have children
Sibling = Children of the same parents
Ancestor = Parent, GrandParent, and great grand parent of a node
Depth of node = A length of the path from root to node
Height of node = A length of the path from the node to the deepest node
Depth of tree = Depth of root node
Height of tree = Height of root node
